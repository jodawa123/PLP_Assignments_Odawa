Love in color
Bolu Babalola takes the most beautiful love stories from history 
and mythology and rewrites them with incredible new detail 
and vivacity in her debut collection. 
Focusing on the magical folktales of West Africa,
Babalola also reimagines iconic Greek myths, 
ancient legends from the Middle East, 
and stories from countries that no longer exist in our world.
